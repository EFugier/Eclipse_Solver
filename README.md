# Eclipse_Solver
Predicts the date of the [march 2016 eclipse](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89clipse_solaire_du_9_mars_2016) using the planetary position a week before.
The only approximation is that the Sun, the Earth and the Moon are supposed spherical. The rersult has less than a minute of error.
